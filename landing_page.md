# Deep Learning Tutorials for Experimental Nuclear Physics

Welcome to the DNP 2025 Deep Learning Tutorials presented at APS-DNP 2025 Data Science Workshop sessions! This Jupyter Book provides comprehensive tutorials on applying deep learning techniques to experimental nuclear physics, specifically for the Forward Calorimeter (FCAL) at GlueX.

## Overview

These tutorials are designed for Nuclear and Paricle Physics and Researchers. We focus on two main applications of deep learning:

1. **CNN-based Classification**: Using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify FCAL showers and distinguish between photons and splitoffs
2. **Generative AI**: Building generative models to simulate FCAL photon showers based on their kinematics.

## Tutorial Goals

By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to:

- Understand the physics behind FCAL showers and the importance of accurate classification
- Prepare and preprocess FCAL data for deep learning applications
- Build and train CNN models for binary classification (photons vs splitoffs)
- Develop generative models (GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models) for FCAL shower simulation
- Evaluate model performance using physics-informed metrics
- Apply these techniques to your own nuclear physics research

## Target Audience

These tutorials are intended for:
- Graduate students and postdocs in nuclear physics
- Researchers working on calorimeter systems
- Scientists interested in applying ML to experimental physics
- Anyone wanting to learn about deep learning in the context of particle physics

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of nuclear physics and particle detectors
- Python programming experience
- Familiarity with NumPy and basic data analysis
- (Optional) Prior exposure to machine learning concepts
