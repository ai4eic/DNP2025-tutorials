# Tutorial Overview

## Introduction

This tutorial series explores the application of deep learning to the Forward Calorimeter (FCAL) at the GlueX experiment. We focus on two critical machine learning tasks:

1. **Classification**: Distinguishing between photon showers and splitoff events in FCAL
2. **Generation**: Creating realistic FCAL shower simulations for different particle types

## Why Deep Learning for FCAL?

### The Challenge

The FCAL is a crucial component of the GlueX detector system, designed to detect electromagnetic showers from photons and other particles. However, accurately identifying and reconstructing these showers presents several challenges:

- **Photon vs Splitoff Classification**: Splitoffs (secondary particles from electromagnetic showers) can mimic photon signatures, leading to misidentification
- **Simulation Efficiency**: Traditional Monte Carlo simulations are computationally expensive
- **Complex Shower Patterns**: FCAL showers exhibit complex spatial and energy distributions that are difficult to model analytically

### Deep Learning Solutions

Deep learning offers powerful tools to address these challenges:

- **CNNs for Classification**: Convolutional Neural Networks can learn hierarchical features from FCAL shower images, achieving high accuracy in photon/splitoff discrimination
- **Generative Models**: GANs, VAEs, and other generative models can produce fast, high-fidelity shower simulations
- **Conditional Generation**: Models can be conditioned on particle kinematics and PID to generate targeted simulations

## Tutorial Structure
